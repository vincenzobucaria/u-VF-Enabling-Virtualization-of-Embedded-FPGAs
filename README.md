🎯 Overview
μ-VF (micro-Virtual Functions) is a novel FPGA virtualization framework designed specifically for resource-constrained edge computing scenarios. Unlike traditional approaches that require full SR-IOV support or complex PCIe infrastructure, μ-VF provides efficient multi-tenant FPGA access through a three-layer architecture optimized for embedded systems.
